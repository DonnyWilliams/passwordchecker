# passwordchecker
This is a program I wrote while going through Zero To Mastery Academy's Complete Python Developer in 2021 class. This program checks to see if any given password has been hacked, and if so, the number of times it's been hacked. The purpose is to give the user this information so they can then decide if they should change their password to something else that is safer.

checkmypass.py is the program code with notes commented out, detailing the thoughts behind each line of code.
checkmypass2.py is the same program code, but without the notes.
